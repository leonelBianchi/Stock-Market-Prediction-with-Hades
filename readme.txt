STOCK MARKET PREDICTION WITH HADES

Web app based on machine learning algorithms to predict the stock market. We use neural networks to generate the predictions. In particular, the LSTM architecture. The DNN takes as input parameters given by the user. This parameters are taken from the left panel on the website.

We use yfinance data to predict the price of a company or cryuptocurrency using LSTM deep learning architecture. 
Future considerations: fundamental analysis with NLP.

Althought it is a good way to learn about neural networks and interact with them, it does not have any application in the real world.
